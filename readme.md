# Assignment 03 - FaceCam Pop Art
### By Madeline Archibald 

Created for NMED 3720 at the University of Lethbridge, the CLM Facetracker allows the user to have their face tracked through the createCapture function. From there, specific points on the face tracker can be targeted and linked in creative, visual expressions. I chose to experiment with shapes and colours to produce a pop art instance of the user's facial features, expressed through vivid colours and interactive patterns.

Diving into this project was indeed a challenge, but also a trip down memory lane as I explored terms used in Processing languages. This time, using P5 JS, it was interesting to integrate the language of web development with the language of Processing - both of which are based on similar values and foundations, which allows for convenient fluidity in coding endeavors. The most challenging part was figuring out the if statements and ligning up certain points with specific pixels. However, in the end, I managed to create an interactive and amusing tribute to pop art styles that the user can explore with their device and their face!
